    "# Jupyter Notebook Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks were designed such that other developers could extend their functionality. A set of Jupyter Notebooks extensions is found in the [jupyter_contrib_nbextensions][0] package. Instructions for installing the package are found in the **Installing Python and Setting up an Environment for Data Science** chapter. If you have not yet installed this package, you can do so with a single command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These extensions are contributed by a community not officially related to Jupyter so they may not all work as well as the other components in the notebook. There also might be issues when using multiple different extensions simultaneously, so I advise to use as few as possible at one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The NBextensions tab\n",
    "If you installed the jupyter_contrib_nbextensions package correctly, you will see a new tab titled **NBExtensions** when you first run Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "![][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on this tab to reveal the several dozen extensions available.\n",

    "## The Skip-Traceback Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "I only recommend activating the **Skip-Traceback** extension for this book. You'll notice that it is unable to be selected at the current state. Look at the top-left corner of the page under the **Configurable nbextensions** header. There is a checkbox that warns about possible compatibility issues with the notebook breaking for certain extensions. This is a warning and means that not all of the extensions have been fully tested. I have yet to encounter any person having issue with the Skip-Traceback extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncheck the box and then activate the Skip-Traceback extension. Most extensions provide a few options to control their functionality. Scroll down the page and you'll see a checkbox next to an option for 'add a button to the toolbar...'. Go ahead and check the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "![][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Because I do a lot of writing in the notebooks, I also activate the **spellchecker** extension which highlights misspelled words when editing a markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skip-Traceback in the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up a new Jupyter Notebook or reload the page for this current notebook and you will see a little icon with an exclamation mark within a triangle in the menu bar above. By default, the Skip-Traceback feature will be turned on.\n",
    "\n",
    "![][4]\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name implies, the extension allows you to skip the traceback. So, what is a traceback? A **traceback** is the set of programming statements that were executed whenever an error occurs in the program. Tracebacks allow you to literally trace back the steps of execution to help you find bugs. While this feature is helpful for developers, it isn't helpful for users of the library who are only interested in the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Skip-Traceback is activated, only the error message are visible and not the complete traceback. The reason this can be extremely useful is that tracebacks for some libraries like pandas can be very long and take up the entire screen. The following image shows the complete traceback for the case when a column name that does not exist is selected from a DataFrame. This is a very common error and it's unnecessary to see this wall of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "![][5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip-Traceback will only show the most important part of the traceback for the users, which is the type of error and the error message, which typically is just a single line of output. Skip-Traceback provides a toggle arrow to reveal the traceback if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "![][6]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skip-Traceback is optional\n",
    "\n",
    "I find the Skip-Traceback extension to be extremely useful, especially for those new to programming. It allows you to focus on the error message which is the most important part of the traceback. Even so, it is not a necessary component of the book and so you may not enable it if desired.\n",
