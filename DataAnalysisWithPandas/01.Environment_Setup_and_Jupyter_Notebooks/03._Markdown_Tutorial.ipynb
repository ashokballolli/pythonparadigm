    "# Markdown Tutorial\n",

    "I believe learning markdown is very valuable as it provides a means to improve the quality of the notebooks you create and even turn them into reports that can be published. In fact, the entirety of this book is written in markdown within Jupyter Notebooks. This tutorial will not cover all of the markdown specification, but instead focus on a few of the most important and useful commands. To learn more markdown, visit the following two resources:  \n",

    "## Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "Headers are larger-sized text that precede a paragraph of text. Headers are created by beginning a line with hash symbols followed by a space and then by the text of the header. Let's see an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`# Some header`\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing the above in a markdown cell creates the largest possible header. If you are familiar with HTML, it corresponds with an **H1** header. Adding more hash symbols will decrease the size of the header. For instance, `#### Some header` creates an **H4** header. The smallest header, **H6**, uses six hash symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Italics and bold\n",
    "To italicize words, surround them with a single asterisk. For instance, `*some phrase*` would create *some phrase* in markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make words bold, surround them with a two consecutive asterisks. `**some phrase**` becomes **some phrase**."

    "## Code formatting\n",
    "When writing code within text, it's important that is formatted differently in order to read it as code more easily. To format code, wrap the contents in backticks, \\`. For instance, \\`a = 99\\` renders as `a = 99`. You can write blocks of code on separate lines with three backticks to start and end the block. The following shows an example of how you would write a few lines of code in a block.  "

    "It is possible to create both unordered and ordered lists. Unordered lists are created by beginning a line with a single asterisk followed by a space.

    "It is possible to create a hyperlink to any valid URL. There are two types of links, **reference** and **inline**. For both types, you begin by placing the words you would like to link within square brackets. For reference links, append an additional set of square brackets immediately following these brackets and place the reference text inside. The reference text can be anything, but I typically use numbers. Finally, place the reference text within square brackets on its own line followed by a colon and the URL. I can link to my business's home page like this:\n",
