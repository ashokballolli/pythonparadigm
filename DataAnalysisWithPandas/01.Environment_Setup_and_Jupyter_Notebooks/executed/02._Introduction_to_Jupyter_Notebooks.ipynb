    "# Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebook Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where am I?\n",
    "If you have never seen this application, then you might be wondering what strange place you have landed on the internet. You are now running a **Jupyter Notebook** server from your localhost at default port 8888. This specific notebook is connected to an IPython kernel capable of executing Python commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Jupyter Notebooks and why are we using them?\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks allow you to interactively write code, visualize results, and enhance the output via markdown, HTML, LaTeX, and other rich content streams like this Monte Python image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Monte Python!][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using them because they provide an excellent means to interactively and iteratively explore and visualize data in one place. They are also great for providing space for exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the difference between IPython notebooks and Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "**IPython Notebook** was the original name for these notebooks. IPython itself, is an interactive Python shell that was created by Fernando Perez in 2001. You can run the IPython shell by simply opening a terminal (activating your minimal_ds environment) and running the command `ipython`. IPython Notebooks, created around 2011, gave IPython the web interface we use today. The idea of a web-based notebook was not new. They were already a popular way to do interactive computing in other languages like Maple or Mathematica.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, IPython Notebooks only supported the execution of Python. As IPython Notebooks started to rise in popularity, developers started creating kernels capable of executing other languages. You can see a list of all the [backend execution kernels][4] currently available. In 2015, the project was renamed Jupyter, a name derived from the languages Julia, Python, and R. This '[big split][2]' resulted in the language agnostic bits separated from the actual execution of the code. As it turns out, lots of people enjoy working in this type of an environment and hopefully you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important that you understand the fundamentals of how to use Jupyter Notebooks. They are one of the most popular environments to explore data with and are the environment where all the material for this book was written. The remaining content in this chapter detail the very basics of how to use the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### All notebooks are composed of cells\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are composed of **cells**. Every bit of content within a Jupyter Notebook, including this text, resides within a **cell**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown and Code cells\n",
    "There are two primary types of cells - **Markdown** and **Code** cells. The cell containing this text is a markdown cell. Markdown is a simple plain-text language that allows you to add some basic styles and links with little effort. Markdown is easy to learn with only about a dozen common commands. A brief tutorial is provided in a later chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For nearly all of the book, you will be working inside **Code** cells. Code cells are where you write and execute your Python code. Code cells only understand Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifying Markdown and Code Cells\n",
    "It is easy to identify whether you are in a markdown or code cell. Click anywhere on this text exactly **once**. The outside border of the cell will turn **blue**. The word **Markdown** will also appear in the dropdown box in the center of the menu at the top of this page. \n",
    "\n",
    "![][6]\n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells will have the word **Code** in that same menu. Also, all code cells will have the word **`In`** displayed directly to the left of the cell and a number inside of brackets denoting its order of execution. If there is no number inside the brackets, then the code cell has yet to be executed. If the cell has been executed, the result will be displayed directly below with the word **`Out`** directly to the left. Some code cells do not output anything upon execution and will not have an **`Out`** section.\n",
    "\n",
    "![][7]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edit Mode vs Command Mode\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook cells are always in one of two modes: **edit** or **command** mode. When in edit mode:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Cells are outlined in **green**\n",
    "* Cells have a blinking cursor in them\n",
    "* Typing results in plain text inside the cell\n",
    "* A small pencil icon is visible in the top right-hand-side of the menu bar\n",
    "\n",
    "When in command mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cells are outlined in **blue**\n",
    "* Cells do not have a blinking cursor and there is nowhere to type\n",
    "* The keys have special meanings\n",
    "* No small pencil icon visible in the top right-hand-side of the menu bar\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selected Cells\n",
    "There is always at least one cell in a notebook that is **selected**. A selected cell will be outlined in either green or blue depending on what mode it is in. Clicking on a cell is one way to select it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing between edit and command Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The very first task we will learn is how to change between edit and command mode. This is a common, valuable, and simple task. Let's practice changing from edit mode to command mode within a code cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Click anywhere in the code cell below. It has a Python comment in green text. Clicking in the cell places you in edit mode. You should see a blinking cursor, a green outline around the cell, and will be able to type text directly into it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Press **esc** once to enter **command** mode. The cell outline will turn blue and the blinking cursor will have disappeared. From command mode, press **enter** to go back into edit mode. Practice changing from edit to command mode several times by alternating between pressing **esc** and **enter**.\n",
